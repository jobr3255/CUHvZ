[SUBJECT] EYES ONLY not hands or teeth

All forces near checkpoint Omega should converge to Beach park. Hostile agents are attracted to unidentified noodle shaped objects which have been detected near a playground and should be handled with extreme care. Civilians have been told that we will be performing fumigation in the area. Get your stories straight. Any unauthorized personnel should be diverted. Secure the objects from any and all hostiles and wait for item extraction.


[SUBJECT] Monday Mission Update

The objects have been secured thanks to shakz, the lone survivor of the mission. Thanks to shakz the alien objects have been secured for observation and the outbreak has been contained so far.

Tomorrow Dr. Wolf will need assistance gathering research on campus. He will be making to runs during the day, one at 10am and the other at 2pm. Escort him according to the following route UMC Fountains -> Theatre -> Koi pond/Hale -> Old Main -> Norlin Fountains -> REC -> Ralphie.

Possible mission points:
All humans that are present for the start of the mission are awarded 10 points
All humans that are alive by the end of the mission are awarded 10 points.

Failure to complete the either escort mission will have consequences.",,,,

Zombie stun timer will start at 5 minutes but can be reduced if humans fail their daily missions.

We've also changed up how are humans have to play. Now humans have a starve timer and inactive humans will die if they don't go out and collect supply drops.
Here are all the sign locations for potential supply drops. Humans must enter the 5 character code, located on the bottom of the signs, in order to receive the supply drop. Keep in mind that there will be a limited number of supply drops at each location so make sure you get there before other humans! You can also receive supply drops by going to off-campus missions.

The skies weep

Great Odin

Ragnarok

Come now warriors

or will you stand
and make the darkness
fear your cry?


Chaos is here, friends, as it has been foretold. The army of the dead have risen to their God's command, and we must stand to face them. The gods are at out back, out weapons blessed by their hands, we must fight so that they might survive so that we might live to see the light of the sun once more. Surtr is coming, we are the last hope. If he triumphs, all will burn in his rage.
Will you answer the call?","Greetings Warriors,

The first signs of Ragnarok are shown, the seer VÃ¶lva has warned me of treachery on the part of my adoptive son Loki and my grandson. On this first day we require more strength to repel the forces of chaos, should they be upon us. On campus today will be late registration and bandanna pick up at the UMC.

Yesterday's mission at Scott Carpenter park proved to be a failure, resulting in the zombie stun timer to be reduced to 4 minutes.

My son Loki is hiding himself in the form a fish. We must obtain pieces of a net that have been scattered throughout campus. To obtain these pieces you must locate these statues and take ""selfies"" and submit them on discord using the instructions provided below. These ""selfies"" will capture the pieces of the net in the picture. All four locations must be captured for the piece of the net to be obtained. Warriors must work together to collect a total of 10 pieces in order to build the net.

Please locate these statues and take a ""selfie"":

Once the net pieces have been collected we can construct the net at Central Park and capture Loki at 6 PM. We must hold the area until the net can be constructed and then we may catch my son.

My children, I understand that you are needing sustenance to continue forth, I have sent you food for you and your families. The supplies have been sent to the following locations with the given amount of supplies at each location:

Sign #2: 25 supplies
Sign #6: 25 supplies
Sign #11: 25 supplies
Sign #18: 25 supplies
By aware the humans may only take one supply drop from any given location but they are allowed to collect from as many locations as they wish. Supply drops will increase the human stun timer by 24 hours with a cap for 48 hours. Collecting a supply drop also rewards that player with 10 points. Zombies cannot collect supply drops but are allowed to stalk those locations.
These supply drops will expire at 5pm today and new ones will be deployed tomorrow.

Tuesday missions report
The on-campus mission resulted in the humans being successful! With a total of 11 full sets of ""selfies"" submitted we were able to retrieve pieces of the net. Unfortunately the off-campus mission proved to be a failure, the humans could not put together the in time and hence forth the zombie stun timer has been reduced to 3 minutes.

On this day I fear the prophesied winters are come, Today we are called to defend the remnants of civilization. There remains two mid-guardian cities who have not fallen to the forces of chaos, and on this day, brave warriors, we are called to defend. On campus at Wolf Law Soccer Field will be soccer defense at 1:30 PM. As well, warriors, today more sustenance will be delivered, humans must gather supplies while they can to avoid starvation.

My children, survival is necessary, we are the last pillars of the realms. We must gather and prepare our forces for the days ahead, at Beach Park at 6 PM. There will be much needed supplies and we must race to retrieve them before the forces of death.

I have sent out more supplies to those in need. Unfortunately these supply drops are not protected by magic and now the zombies can steal the supplies. Luckily these supplies are not made from human flesh and are less effective in feeding the zombies. I also seem to have misplaced one of the supply drops, all I can remember is that it was at an odd sign location. Further rewards will be given to those who find it, please find it before the dead do.
Sign #4: 25 supplies, worth 10 points

Loki has broken free from his chains and the Earth has started to rumble. Buildings are crumbling and are being overrun by Hel's undead army. You must hold your outposts or there will be dire consequences.On campus is tower defense, poles with bandannas tied to them are defenses, humans must hold the towers by putting the bandanna above the line.

Attention League of Heroes,

This is Commissioner Gordon from the Gotham City Police Department.

We recently had an alarming report reach the Gotham Police. Poison Ivy and a band of villains have been planning something dastardly; thereâs been increased activity targeting chemical transports and chemical storage centers. We think they may be planning to create some sort of poison. Those affected by the poison have turned into zombie-like slaves.

I will be dispatched to Boulder, Colorado to attempt to track down these villains before they can complete their plan.

We need you to come and agree to help us track down these fiends. Today at the BOLD[UMC is the final day to receive bandanas and turn in your waiver]. We will have a table set up for you to do so. There will be BOLD[no off campus mission] today on account of weather.

Hello, hello, hello, mindless people of Boulder.

I have a dangerous game to play, for those of you who are able. My games and riddles will bring you down to the cable.

I have many gifts set, now it's time for you to fret. Three by three you must find for me, carefully placed will be the key. Central Park you must go, or let the zombie horde grow.

Follow my riddles, disable my tricks, and you may live to see another day.

So what do you say,
Want to play?

- The Riddler

I have one more riddle for you friends,
We are what is necessary for your life
But if you eat us you may be dead
Pick a number, a supply for you
Beware whether itâs aid is false or true.
Poison can be deadly.

Heroes, this is commissioner Gordon. I do not know what the Riddler is planning but we know he will be active at Central park at 5pm. Please aid me in capturing him and foiling his plans. Careful when collecting these supply drops as it seems The Riddler may have poisoned one of them.

Stay Vigilant,
Commissioner Gordon","[SUBJECT] Winter is Coming and Frost is Leading It
Attention Heroes,

This is Commissioner Gordon. I must first inform you that yesterday's mission failed. The Riddler was able to denote his packages releasing more of Poison Ivy's gas, this has resulted in these 'zombies' becoming more powerful.

---- Zombie stun timer has been reduced to 4 minutes ----

Weâve recently had reports of Killer Frost being active in the Boulder area. She is dangerous, and anyone who has tried to stop her has been frozen and reanimated as one of Ivyâs Zombies. She has been attempting to speed up the process of winter to make people more susceptible to the toxin Poison Ivy is making.
We have a plan on how to stop her: Frost is extremely self-conscious about her appearance and jealousy can be a way to drive her into the open. We need you to take 'selfies' at specific locations showing off yourself and your friends. This should demoralize Frost and make her easier to capture. See image below for locations where the selfies must be taken, we're not sure where these are but we do know that these locations are the ones that will bring Killer Frost out in the open. At least 30 total correct selfies must be achieved to draw her out.
IMAGE[/images/selfie-pics.jpg]

I've also sent out more supplies to those who need it but this batch seems to attract the zombies and they are eating it. Get to those supply drops fast before the zombies steal them all
We have also received information about a robbery that is going to occur at Martin park at 5 pm. Meet there to intercept the thieves.

Best of luck Heroes,
Gordon","[SUBJECT] Infectious Laughter

6,120,"Years after the return of the Avatar and the war had ended a new nation emerged, a nation of blood. Powered by dark spirits and fueled by rage and revenge for their people, a group of blood benders formed Blood Nation.

The blood benders made a deal with the dark spirits, allowing the spirits to inhabit their bodies in exchange for enhancing their blood bending capabilities beyond imagination. The dark spirits bestowed the ability to control anyone from anywhere as long as they have been infected with dark spirit energy.

They have declared war on the Fire Nation and have begun to advance their brainwashed armies. Coming into contact with anyone infected with the dark spirit energy results in the infection immediately spreading and taking control of their mind, joining the Blood Nation.
